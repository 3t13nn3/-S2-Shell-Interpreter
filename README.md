# -S2-Shell-Interpreter

## /!\ LINUX PROJECT /!\

This was my first real project in C then it is a quit buggy project and a code not well written, but at this time I was enough proud.

Lauch the binary as:
  * ```./interpreteur``` if you want to launch the ```test.sh``` script in the folder.
  * ```./interpreteur myScript.sh``` if you want use your personnal Shell script.
  
### What it could interpret:
Commands:
* ```echo```
* ```cat```
* ```ls```
* ```set```
* ```expr``` (without quotes or calcul priority)
  
Conditions:
* ```if```
* ```while```
* ```until```
    
Comments:
* ```#...```
