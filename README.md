# -S2-Shell-Interpreter

This was my first real project in C, it was quite a buggy project and a not well written code, but back then, I was proud enough of it.

### How to use - *Linux Project*

Compile the program with ```make```.

Clean object files and binary by ```make clean```.

Lauch the binary as:
  * ```./interpreteur``` if you want to launch the ```test.sh``` script in the folder.
  * ```./interpreteur myScript.sh``` if you want use your personnal Shell script.

* ```set```
* ```expr``` (without quotes or calcul priority)
  
Conditions:
* ```if```
